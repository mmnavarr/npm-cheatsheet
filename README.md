# NPM Cheatsheet

This document will contain some nitty gritty details about npm that you may or may not already know. It’ll act as a living document with compiled information for reference so that we may all be as educated as possible in the evolving world of node package management.

If anyone stumbles upon this, feel free to add to it via PR.

## Package Installation

Install a package to `node_modules` and also update `package.json` with the installed version and package name.

```
npm install <module-name> --save
```

\
Install a package to `node_modules` and also update `package.json` with the **exact installed version** and package name
```
npm install <module-name> --save-dev
```

\
Set `--save` as a default for npm install
```
npm config set save true
```

\
[Install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install "https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install") all packages in the local node_modules folder. (Either works)
```
npm install
```
```
npm i
```

\
[Clean install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html "https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html") of all packages in the local node_modules folder
(If `node_modules` exists, removed before `npm ci`. Doesn’t write to package.json)
```
npm clean-install
```
```
npm ci
```

### Install a Specific Tag
A tag can be used when installing packages as a reference to a version instead of using a specific version number:

```
npm install <name>@<tag>
``````
```
npm install react@next
```
This also applies to npm dedupe.

\
### Uninstall package (dependency)
```
npm uninstall <module-name>
```
```
npm un <module-name>
```





## What is a package, actually?

A package is:

1) A folder containing a program described by a `package.json` file

2) A gzipped tarball containing (a)

3) A url that resolves to (b)

4) A `<name>@<version>` that is published on the registry (see `npm-registry`) with (c)

5) A `<name>@<tag>` (see` npm-dist-tag`) that points to (d)

6) A `<name>` that has a “latest” tag satisfying (e)

7) A `<git remote url> `that resolves to (a)




## Package Information

List packages used by the applic­ation no depend­encies
```
npm ls — depth 0
```

\
Go to package repository (useful for reading documentation on how to use the npm package)
```
npm repo <module-name>
```

\
See package information on the command line *(My personal favorite)
```
npm info <module-name>
```
```
npm view <module-name>
```

\
See what version of a package the current working directory has
```
npm show <module-­nam­e> version
```

\
Search for a package
```
npm search <module-name>
```

##  Miscellaneous Package Management

Remove duplicates of referenced packages
```
npm dedupe
```

\
Removes packages that are installed but not listed in the package.json
```
npm prune
```


## Publishing & Versioning

For a deeper understanding of semantic versioning see: [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/ "https://semver.org/")
\
**Patch** upgrade to the current version of the npm package (1.0.1 → 1.0.2)
```
npm version patch
```

\
**Minor** upgrade to the current version of the npm package (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
```
npm version minor
```

\
**Major** upgrade to the current version of the npm package (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
```
npm version major
```

\
Publish a package to the npm registry. This is generally executed after patch/minor/major upgrades (see above) so the package can be updated in the registry. (Default @latest tag)
```
npm publish
```

\
Publish a package to the npm registry **not under the default “latest” tag**. This can be used for prerelease versions like alpha/beta, etc.
```
npm publish --tag beta
```

\
_*By default, other than latest, no tag has any special significance to npm itself.*_

## NPM Itself

Update the global npm version
```
npm update npm -g
```

\
Update the global npm version if you’re on good ole’ Windows (can't confirm - I'm a mac guy but this was in their documentation)
```
npm-windows-upgrade
```

\
Tool to manipulate the local package cache (use in the event of weird node_modules issues)
```
npm cache clean
```

\
Execute package from the local node_modules in the command line. (In case you don't want to install something globally or need to use it locally.)
```
npx <module-name>
```

\
Fun fact:

Since npm was originally designed for node packages, the npm start command will automatically run the server.js file hence why you do not need to specify which file/script you want to run.
